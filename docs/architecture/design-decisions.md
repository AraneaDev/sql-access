- **Factory pattern** for adapter creation based on configuration

```typescript
interface DatabaseAdapter {
  connect(config: DatabaseConfig): Promise<void>;
  executeQuery(query: string, params?: any[]): Promise<QueryResult>;
  getSchema(): Promise<DatabaseSchema>;
  disconnect(): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Easy to add new database types
- Database-specific optimizations possible
